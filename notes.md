1.	Interfacing with C Code:
	•	You can call C functions, use C types, and share data between Go and C.
	2.	Importing C Code:
	•	Use #cgo directives to specify compiler and linker flags.
	•	Embed raw C code inside import "C" block in Go.
	3.	Data Interoperability:
	•	C structs, pointers, and arrays can be used in Go via C.struct_name, *C.type, etc.
